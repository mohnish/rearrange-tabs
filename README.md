Rearrange Tabs is a tiny Google Chrome Extension that allows users
to rearrange the position of the tabs in a window by moving them
around using keyboard shortcuts.

Rearrange Tabs has been featured on [LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com/this-extension-rearranges-chrome-tabs-with-keyboard-sho-1791622486) and [Changelog](http://email.changelog.com/t/t-9A7FDF4C536D63BF) :smile:

- To move a tab to its left

  - `Mac`: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>Left</kbd>
  - `Windows`: <kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>Left</kbd>

- To move a tab to its right

  - `Mac`: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>Right</kbd>
  - `Windows`: <kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>Right</kbd>

- To move a tab to a new window

  - `Mac`: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>Up</kbd>
  - `Windows`: <kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>Up</kbd>

It's as simple as that. Here's how it looks like: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1X3geKtF8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1X3geKtF8A)
